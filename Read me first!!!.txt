Use the CodePlex version.
-------------------------

Do NOT bother with the Interim Version; it's badly oudated.

Morph is not new, and I had multiple versions from different repositories over the years. When resurrecting Morph, I initially picked the wrong repository (based on modification dates) and wasted a fair bit of time making it run using Visual Studio 2017, as it was too broken for Visual Studio 2022.

Later I examined the versions more carefully, and found the CodePlex version to be the latest and greatest.
It even compiled and ran with *no effort* using Visual Studio 2022!  Doh!  <facepalm>
