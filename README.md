# Morph

The Morph Protocol is hosted here:
https://github.com/BatSoft-Tools/Morph

The definition of the Morph protocol hosted at https://github.com/BatSoft-Tools/Morph/Definition is the official definition and the only valid definition of the Morph protocol.
The Morph protocol is free for anyone to implement and use, but it is not to be altered nor extended in any way outside of this definition.
Any suggestions for changes to the Morph Protocol should be sent to: peter@batsoft.com.au
The reason for these restrictions is to prevent fragmentation and incompatibilities that would reduce the potential for the Morph protocol from becoming a ubiquitously available and useful protocol.

This repository also contains an implementation written in C# using Visual Studio.
This C# implementation of the Morph Protocol has no restrictions nor limitations placed upon it. Anyone may use, copy, alter, translate, study it without any restrictions or limitations whatsoever.
