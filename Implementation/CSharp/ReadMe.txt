Currently, Morph builds, but is not yet tested.
Still need to get the demos to build and run.

To install/uninstall:
1. Edit the batch files to correct the path to the Morph.Daemon.exe service.
2. Right click on a batch file and select "Run as administrator".
3. The Morph Daemon service should be installed/uninstalled in the Windows' Services application.
